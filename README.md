# 30 Day Web Development Challenge

Four weeks, four simple one-page web pages.
Designs were marked up from free PSD design resources found online.

## DSGN
This was my first stab at a CSS-only, full-width, gutterless Bootstrap Grid. Slightly challenging but very fun!

## Focus
For the Focus PSD Theme, I used SVG images to make an interactive hero element. I also used CSS sprites to create a horizontal-scrolling avatar cloud with a CSS hover-based testimonial section. Very sleek design and easy to mark up. CSS-only functionality was exciting to learn.
